                    <p>The kids have to be the king at home. If your kids do something bad just whisper in their ears, because 
                    if you raise your voice they will get hurt, and may listen to you sometimes. 
                    If the kids did something bad do not tell them immediately, just do it later and they will not have any ghost of notion 
                        what you are even talking about.
                    Teach them that they do not have to take responsibility, and the best solution to annoy others to act like a bitch.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>If you have a girl not necessary to teach them how to control their feelings, and give to her everything when she cries. So they 
                        will know they can rest and continue to create the soap opera in their head.
                    Girls also should learn how to be the most dramatic, because of the lack of emotional control. Once for this a lucky man will tell you thank you.
                    For girls also mandatory to learn how to blame others, what is really crucial nowadays, otherwise they can 
                        not cover their mental disabilities.
                    They also have to know how to be materialistic and to make drama, till they do not get what they want. This is the key to their true hapinnes.

                    If you have a boy, teach them before marrying to that type of woman, just should ask an appointment to the psychologist in advance,
                    because the frustrated princess girl game will make their life a living hell, and they will become so depressed.
                    Teach also to your boy to avoid the above mentioned things, just marry to someone else except to a frustrated princess.
